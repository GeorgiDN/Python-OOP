# Condition
# We have been hired to create a game where the player sets up entertainment systems.
# Each piece of the system (television, game console, etc.)
# uses a specific cable to connect to another device.
# The TV uses an HDMI cable to connect to a game console.
# Both the game console and TV connect to a router via an ethernet cable to access the internet.
# And lastly, all the devices are connected to the wall via a power cable so they can turn on.
# Your job is to extend this behavior in the device classes.
